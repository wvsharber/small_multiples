    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Small multiples is a visualization technique that partions your data such that you're visualizing one piece of it at a time. These pieces are stored as series of individual plots (i.e. subplots) that share the same x and y-axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having each subplot on the same scale makes it easier for the reader to compare one subplot to the next without having to mentally account for different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "For you to be able to create small multiples in python using [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplots_demo.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial was inspired by Yan Holtz's [_Small Multiples for Line Charts_](https://python-graph-gallery.com/125-small-multiples-for-line-chart/) tutorial. \n"

    "\n",
    "As seen [in the `matplotlib` documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplots_demo.html#stacking-subplots-in-two-directions), we want to create a plot figure that contains a 3X3 grid. Each of the 9 subplots will be accessible by indexing the `axs` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Indexing `axs`\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the subplot in the upper left corner, index `axs` by typing `axs[0, 0]`. You read that as \"the subplot in the first row in the first column\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To access the subplot in the bottom right corner, you type `axs[2, 2]`. You read that as \"the subplot in the third row in the third column\".\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to index a particular subplot via `axs[row][col]`, [`numpy` documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/user/basics.indexing.html) discourages this behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "> So note that `x[0, 2]` = `x[0][2]` though the second case is more inefficient as a new temporary array is created after the first index that is subsequently indexed by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Always helpful to remember that [Python using zero based indexing](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2013/10/why-python-uses-0-based-indexing.html).*\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid manually typing each subplot, we'll access each subplot by using two `for` loops: one for `row` and one for `column`. Additionally, we'll add a value of `1` to the `counter` object after each subplot so that we can highlight one teammate in color.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adding things to the `fig`\n",
    "\n",
    "Only after the subplots are drawn do we worry about adding elements to `fig`. Here, we'll be creating a title that will be placed in the middle of the figure at the very top. We'll also be adding labels to the x and y-axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll save the figure as a `PNG` file.\n"
